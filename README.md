# nupdf
This code is intended as a PDF/Image merger (to PDF).

It has a few custom options:
- rotate specific pages
- add bookmark to the PDF following the name of the merged documents
- merge files as a zipper (take one page from each document to merge alternatively)

# formats accepted
PDF or images (JPG, PNG, GIF, RAW). The output is always a PDF file. If images are merged a intermediate PDF file will be created with the image.

# to do
Clarify README. Simplify interface and clarify description titles.
